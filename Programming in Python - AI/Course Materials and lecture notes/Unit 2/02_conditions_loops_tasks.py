"""

#
# Task 1
#

# Run through values in the range [3, 20) and compute the sum of their squares.
# Use a for loop to solve this task.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 2
#

# Run through values in the range [3, 20) and compute the sum of their squares.
# Use a while loop to solve this task.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 3
#

# Run through values in the range [3, 20) and print only those numbers that are
# divisible by 3 (without remainder).

# Your code here #


#
# Task 4
#

# Create an empty string "some_string" and append user (console) input to this
# string until the user types "end". This last word "end" should not be appended
# to "some_string".

# Your code here #


#
# Task 5
#

# Use a while loop to implement a pseudo-login scenario in which a user is asked
# to enter a password (console input). If the password is correct, print "Login
# success". Otherwise, let the user try again. In case of entering three wrong
# passwords, print "Contact the administrator to recover password". The choice
# of the correct password is up to you.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 6
#

# Read a string from the console input. Iterate through this string and count
# the number of digits (0-9), the number of lowercase characters and the number
# of other characters (neither digits nor lowercase characters). You can use the
# string methods "c.isdigit()" and "c.islower()".

# Your code here #


#
# Task 7
#

# Use a double-nested loop to iterate through both of the strings "text" and
# "chars_to_check". If the current character from "text" matches one in
# "chars_to_check", print it together with its index position in "text".
text = "some string"
chars_to_check = "aeiou"

# Your code here #
