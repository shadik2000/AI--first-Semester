# Code blocks and indentation
################################################################################

# Python uses indentation to form blocks of code and statements in contrast to,
# e.g., {} in other languages. Indentation can be done via tabs or spaces. It is
# common to use 4 spaces (in most editors, this is the default, or you can set
# tab to equal 4 spaces). In certain cases, you might not want to execute any
# code, but Python still requires the indentation for correct syntax. If so, use
# the "pass" statement, which is a no-op (no operation) and does nothing.


################################################################################
# if, elif, else
################################################################################

# if-elif-else statements are useful when conditionally executing code, i.e.,
# some code should only be executed if certain conditions are/are not fulfilled.
# Together with loops (see further below), they constitute the basic control
# flow structures, which are essential in programming. For more details, see
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement

# Code within an "if" statement is executed only if the condition is True.
condition = True
if condition:
    print("This code block is executed since 'condition' is 'True'!")

condition = False
if condition:
    print("This code block is not executed since 'condition' is 'False'!")
    
if not condition:  # Here we use "not False" as condition
    print("'not False' evaluates to 'True', so this code block is executed!")

# We can combine the "if" statement with an "else" statement. This will execute
# the "if" part only if the condition is True, otherwise, the "else" is run.
condition = True
if condition:
    print("This code block is executed!")
else:

          "executed!")

if not condition:
    print("This code block is not executed!")
else:
    print("This code block is executed since the 'if'-part was not executed!")

# We can also combine the "if" statement with "elif" statements. Doing this, the
# conditions in the if-elif statements are checked one after the other. Only the
# part where the first condition is True is executed - the rest is ignored.
condition = True
if not condition:
    print("This code block is not executed!")
elif not condition:
    print("This code block is not executed!")

          "already executed!")
elif not condition:
    print("This code block is not executed since a previous if-part was "
          "already executed!")

# We can also combine the "if", "elif" and "else" statements. The conditions in
# the if-elif-else statements are checked one after the other. Only the part
# where the first condition is True is executed - the rest is ignored. If none
# of the if-elif parts are executed, the "else" part will be run.

elif not condition:
    print("This code block is not executed!")
elif not condition:
    print("This code block is not executed!")
else:
    print("This code block is executed since no other part was executed!")

# if-else can also be used as part of an expression, which returns the result
# according to how the boolean condition evaluates. Syntax:
# return_value = x if condition else y
# where "return_value" would be "x" if "condition" evaluated to True, or "y"
# otherwise. Example:
number = -123
sign = "-" if number < 0 else "+"

# Comparisons and boolean operations
################################################################################

#
# Comparisons
#

# We already saw that we need boolean values as conditions to decide which parts
# of code to execute in the if-elif-else statements. Comparisons in Python allow
# us to compare two objects and return a boolean value. You can use comparisons
# on objects of different data types. For more details, see
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons

# Assume we have two variables "a" and "b" that refer to int objects:
a = 1
b = 2

# There are 8 comparison operations in Python:
equal = a == b  # Check if "a" is equal to "b"
not_equal = a != b  # Check if "a" is not equal to "b"
greater = a > b  # Check if "a" is greater than "b"
greater_equal = a >= b  # Check if "a" is greater than or equal to "b"
less = a < b  # Check if "a" is less than "b"
less_equal = a <= b  # Check if "a" is less than or equal to "b"
same_object = a is b  # Check if "a" and "b" refer to same object (identity check)
not_same_object = a is not b  # Check if "a" and "b" do not refer to same object

# Integers and floats of the same value yield True in the equality comparison,
# despite being different data types (equality is based on the numerical value)
equal = 1 == 1.0
# However, int 1 and float 1.0 are not the same object (they are two different
# objects in memory)
same_object = 1 is 1.0

# All objects support the "==" and "!=" operator, which is, by default,
# equivalent to "is" and "is not". Often, special support is provided to change
# this behavior, e.g., to compare values instead of object references such as it
# is the case for integers, floats, strings, etc.

# Other comparison operators are only supported by non-numerical objects "if
# they make sense". For example, you can use them on strings (comparisons are
# done lexicographically based on the strings' characters in their Unicode code
# point representation):
is_true = "abc" == "abc"
is_true = "abc" >= ""
is_true = "abc" >= "a"
is_true = "abc" >= "ab"
is_true = "abc" >= "abc"
is_false = "abc" >= "abd"
is_false = "abc" >= "abd"
# Danger: Make sure you are using the data types you intend to use:
is_true = 100 > 20
is_false = "100" > "20"  # Because "1" is smaller than "2" as a character

# Here, we combine comparisons and if-elif-else statements:
a = 2
b = 3
if a > b:
    print("a > b !")
elif a < b:
    print("a < b !")
elif a == b:
    print("a == b !")
else:
    print("How did I get here?")

#
# Boolean operations
#

# You can chain comparisons using boolean operations like "and" or "or".
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations

# "and" will be True if and only if both of the two expressions that it combines
# evaluate to True:
is_false = False and False
is_false = False and True
is_false = True and False
is_true = True and True

# "or" will be True if and only if one or both of the two expressions that it
# combines evaluate to True:
is_false = False or False
is_true = False or True
is_true = True or False
is_true = True or True

# The priority of comparisons is higher than that of boolean operations but
# lower than mathematical operators (for an exhaustive list, see
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence):
is_true = (1 > -4) and (1 == 1)  # Equal to no parentheses: 1 > -4 and 1 == 1
is_true = (1 > -4) and (1 == 1) and (1 < 4)  # Again, parentheses are optional here
is_false = (1 > -4) and not (1 < 4)  # Again, parentheses are optional here

# You can also chain comparisons without "and" or "or":
is_true = 1 < 4 <= 5  # Equal to: 1 < 4 and 4 <= 5

# Short-circuit evaluation:
# For "or", if the first boolean expression is already True, the evaluation of
# the second expression is skipped (the combined expression can never be False).
# For "and", if the first boolean expression is already False, the evaluation of
# the second expression is skipped (the combined expression can never be True).

# If "a" equals 0, "b / a > 10" is skipped
if a == 0 or b / a > 10:
    pass  # pass statement = do not do anything (no operation)

my_string = ""
# If "my_string" is empty, i.e., it has a length of 0, 'my_string[0] == "f"' is
# skipped
if len(my_string) >= 1 and my_string[0] == "f":
    pass

# Note: "and" and "or" are evaluated in a boolean context, but they ultimately
# return the actual value (the last value following the short-circuit evaluation
# rules) rather than True or False. Examples for "and" ("or" is analogous):
and_return = 0 and 1  # -> bool(val1) and bool(val2) -> False and True -> return val1
and_return = 1 and 2  # -> bool(val1) and bool(val2) -> True and True -> return val2


################################################################################
# while loops
################################################################################

# While loops continue as long as the loop condition is True. For more details,
# see https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement

# The code of this loop is run exactly 10 times:
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# The code of this loop is not run, since the condition is immediately False:
i = 0
while i < 0:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# This would run forever (endless/infinite loop):
# i = 0
# while True:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1


################################################################################
# for loops
################################################################################

# For loops in Python iterate over a so-called iterable. This can be, e.g., a
# range object, a list, dictionary, tuple, string or function return/yield (we
# will learn all this later). For now, we will focus only on range objects and
# strings.

# Again, we rely on some Python built-in magic, which is called "range" in this
# case. "range" returns a range of integer numbers and can be called as follows:
# range(stop) -> returns numbers in the range [0, stop) with a step size of 1
# range(start, stop) -> returns numbers in the range [start, stop) with a step
#     size of 1
# range(start, stop, step) -> returns numbers in the range [start, stop) with a
#     step size of "step" (can be negative)
for x in range(5):  # [0, 5) -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    print(x)
for x in range(2, 6):  # [2, 6) -> 2, 3, 4, 5
    print(x)
for x in range(0, 10, 2):  # [0, 10) step 2 -> 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
    print(x)

# Getting the sum of all integer numbers up to "n" (inclusive):
n = 100
sum_up_to_n = 0
for x in range(n + 1):  # "stop" is exclusive, so we need the +1
    sum_up_to_n += x

# A string is also an iterable object (sequence of characters):
for char in "hello":
    print(char)

# If you want to iterate over iterable elements and get the number of the
# current loop iteration, you can use the "enumerate" function (again, just
# treat this as magic for now, we will learn about functions later):
for i, char in enumerate("hello"):
    print(f"loop iteration: {i}, element: '{char}'")

# Using the already known magic "len" function and string indexing with the [i]
# syntax, the above code could also be written as:
hello = "hello"
for i in range(len(hello)):
    print(f"loop iteration: {i}, element: '{hello[i]}'")


################################################################################
# break, continue, else
################################################################################

# The following concepts apply for both the while loop and the for loop.

# The "break" and "continue" keywords can be used to either escape the loop or
# to jump to the next element/loop iteration immediately (the rest of the loop
# code is ignored)
for i in range(10):
    if i == 4:
        continue  # Continue with next loop iteration
    elif i == 8:
        break  # Leave the loop, i.e., jump to the code after the loop
    print(i)

# The "else" keyword put after a loop has a special meaning in Python. It is
# only executed if the loop has finished properly, i.e., the for loop iterable
# was exhausted or the while loop condition was False.
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Made it to the end!")  # Not executed since we exited the loop manually

            # is exactly what we integrate here as a short sanity check. If the
            # assertion fails, we immediately know that we made a mistake.
