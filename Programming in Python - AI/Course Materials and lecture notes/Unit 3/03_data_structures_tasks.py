#
# Task 1
#

# Create a list with values 5, "a", 7. Then create a variable that points to the
# same object as the second element in the list.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 2
#

# Append the integer 5 to the end of the given list (use the "+" operator) and
# store the new list in a variable. Afterward, change the first element in this
# new list to integer 0. Print both lists.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Your code here #


#
# Task 3
#

# Assign the given list to a new variable and append the integer 5 to the end of
# this list (use the in-place method "append"). Afterward, change the first
# element in this list to integer 0. Print both lists.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Your code here #


#
# Task 4
#

# Append the integer 5 to the end of the given tuple (use the "+" operator) and
# store the new tuple in a variable. Afterward, try to change the first element
# in this tuple to integer 0. Why will it not work to overwrite the element in
# the tuple? What can you do to create a new tuple where the first element is 0?
a = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Your code here #


#
# Task 5
#

# Add an entry with key "c" and value 3 to the given dictionary.
a = dict(a=1, b=2)  # Equal to: a = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

# Your code here #


#
# Task 6
#

# Create a list with numbers from 0 to 100, excluding 100 (use "range"). Then,
# extract every third element starting at index 50 until index 70 and store it
# in a new list. Use slicing to solve this task.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 7
#

# String "a" contains elements that are separated by either a comma "," or a
# semicolon ";" character. Reverse the order of elements and replace the "," and
# ";" characters by a colon ":".
a = "element1,element2;element3;element4;element5,element6"

# Your code here #


#
# Task 8
#

# Add two elements 7 and 9 to a nested list "nl" so that it becomes
# [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, [6, 7, 8, 9], 10, 11], 12, 13, 14]
# Afterward, flatten it to become a one-dimensional list

#
# Task 9
#

# Create a dictionary "d3" that combines the two given dictionaries "d1" and
# "d2". Then, replace the entry {6: "five"} by {5: "five"}. Desired result:
# {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four", 5: "five"}
