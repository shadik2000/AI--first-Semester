#
# Task 1
#

# Create a list with values 5, "a", 7. Then create a variable that points to the
# same object as the second element in the list.

# Your code here #
a = [5, "a", 7]
x = a[1]


#
# Task 2
#

# Append the integer 5 to the end of the given list (use the "+" operator) and
# store the new list in a variable. Afterward, change the first element in this
# new list to integer 0. Print both lists.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Your code here #
b = a + [5]
b[0] = 0
print(a)
print(b)


#
# Task 3
#

# Assign the given list to a new variable and append the integer 5 to the end of
# this list (use the in-place method "append"). Afterward, change the first
# element in this list to integer 0. Print both lists.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Your code here #
b = a
b.append(5)
b[0] = 0
print(a)
print(b)


#
# Task 4
#

# Append the integer 5 to the end of the given tuple (use the "+" operator) and
# store the new tuple in a variable. Afterward, try to change the first element
# in this tuple to integer 0. Why will it not work to overwrite the element in
# the tuple? What can you do to create a new tuple where the first element is 0?
a = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Your code here #
b = a + (5,)
# b[0] = 0  # This will fail because tuples are immutable
# However, we can always stitch together a new tuple from other tuples:
b = (0,) + b[1:]


#
# Task 5
#

# Add an entry with key "c" and value 3 to the given dictionary.
a = dict(a=1, b=2)  # Equal to: a = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

# Your code here #
a["c"] = 3


#
# Task 6
#

# Create a list with numbers from 0 to 100, excluding 100 (use "range"). Then,
# extract every third element starting at index 50 until index 70 and store it
# in a new list. Use slicing to solve this task.

# Your code here #
a = list(range(100))
a2 = a[50:70:3]  # start=50, stop=70, step=3


#
# Task 7
#

# String "a" contains elements that are separated by either a comma "," or a
# semicolon ";" character. Reverse the order of elements and replace the "," and
# ";" characters by a colon ":".
a = "element1,element2;element3;element4;element5,element6"

# Your code here #
# One way of solving this is to split string "a" at characters "," and ";",
# which will give us a list with the elements we are interested in. Then, we can
# reverse the list and join the elements with a ":" character to a string. To
# split the string we need to find a common split character. We can replace ";"
# by ",", then all elements are separated by ",".
common_a = a.replace(";", ",")  # Now all elements are separated by ","
split_a = common_a.split(",")  # Get a list of all ","-separated elements
reversed_a = split_a[::-1]  # Now we reverse the order of elements in the list
a = ":".join(reversed_a)  # Join the list elements by ":" to new string


#
# Task 8
#

# Add two elements 7 and 9 to a nested list "nl" so that it becomes
# [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, [6, 7, 8, 9], 10, 11], 12, 13, 14]
# Afterward, flatten it to become a one-dimensional list
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
nl = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, [6, 8], 10, 11], 12, 13, 14]

# Your code here #
nl[3][2].append(9)
nl[3][2].insert(1, 7)
print(nl)

sub_list = nl[3]  # Get sub list at index 3
sub_sub_list = sub_list[2]  # Get sub list at index 2 of sub_list
sub_list[2:3] = sub_sub_list  # Replace element at index 2 of sub_list by elements of sub_sub_list
nl[3:4] = sub_list  # Replace element at index 3 of list a by elements of sub_list
print(nl)

# Alternative solution:
nl = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, [6, 8], 10, 11], 12, 13, 14]
nl[3][2].append(9)
nl[3][2].insert(1, 7)
sub_list = nl[3]  # Get sub list at index 3
sub_sub_list = sub_list[2]  # Get sub list at index 2 of sub_list
nl = nl[:3] + sub_list[:2] + sub_sub_list + sub_list[3:] + nl[4:]
print(nl)


#
# Task 9
#

# Create a dictionary "d3" that combines the two given dictionaries "d1" and
# "d2". Then, replace the entry {6: "five"} by {5: "five"}. Desired result:
# {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four", 5: "five"}
d1 = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
d2 = {4: "four", 6: "five"}

# We could also have done this instead:
# d3[5] = d3[6]
# del d3[6]
