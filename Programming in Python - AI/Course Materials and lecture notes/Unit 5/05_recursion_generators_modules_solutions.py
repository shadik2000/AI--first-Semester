#
# Task 1
#

# Write a function with a variable number of integer arguments that specify the
# shape of a multidimensional int matrix (use nested lists as implementation).
# For instance, if the user calls "matrix(2, 3)", a nested list is returned,
# where the outer list has 2 inner lists, and each inner list has 3 ints. By
# default, 0 should be used as int values, but the user can specify a different
# fill value via an optional parameter. Use recursion to solve this task.

# Your code here #


def matrix(*args, fill_value: int = 0):
    if not args:
        return []
    if len(args) == 1:
        return [fill_value] * args[0]
    outer = []
    for _ in range(args[0]):
        outer.append(matrix(*args[1:], fill_value=fill_value))
    return outer


#
# Task 2
#

# Write a function that takes an arbitrary number of positional arguments as
# input. You can assume these arguments are either strings or nested lists of
# strings. Create a flat (=not nested) list from these arguments that holds only
# the strings. Use the built-in function "isinstance(a, list)" to check if some
# object "a" is of type "list". Use recursion to solve this task.
some_list = ["file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
some_nested_list = ["file4.png", "file5.txt", ["file6.txt", "file7.dat"]]
# Example function call:
# my_function("file0.txt", "file1.png", some_list, some_nested_list)

# Your code here #


def my_function(*args):
    # First, we create a new list
    result = []
    # Then, we loop over the input arguments (if any)
    for arg in args:
        if isinstance(arg, str):
            # If the argument is a string, append it to our "result" list
            result.append(arg)
        elif isinstance(arg, list):
            # If the argument is a list, call the function again to process the
            # list recursively. However, it is absolutely crucial that we unpack
            # this list argument here, or we get an endless recursion.
            # Afterwards, it will return the processed list of strings, so we
            # can just concatenate it with our "result" list.
            result += my_function(*arg)
    return result


#
# Task 3
#

# Write a generator function "next_element(my_sequence)" that yields the next
# element in "my_sequence". If the sequence is exhausted (i.e., if the last
# element has been reached), the next element should be the first element again.
# Write a loop that calls "next_element" 25 times and prints the currently
# returned value. Example function call:
# next_element("abcdefg")

# Your code here #


def next_element(my_sequence):
    i = 0
    while True:
        yield my_sequence[i]
        i += 1
        if i >= len(my_sequence):
            i = 0


# Alternative solution 1:
def next_element(my_sequence):
    i = 0
    while True:
        # % is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder after a division
        yield my_sequence[i % len(my_sequence)]
        i += 1


# Alternative solution 2:
def next_element(my_sequence):

for j, element in enumerate(next_element("abcdefg")):
    print(f"[{j}] element: {element}")
    if j >= 24:
        break


#
# Task 4
#

# Write a generator function "next_element(my_sequence, max_iter)" that yields
# the next element in "my_sequence". If the sequence is exhausted (i.e., if the
# last element has been reached), the next element should be the first element
# again. Only a maximum of "max_iter" elements should be returned. Write a loop
# that calls "next_element" until some specified "max_iter" is reached and
# prints the currently returned value. Example function call:
# next_element("abcdefg", max_iter=20)

# Your code here #

    i = 0
    j = 0

        if i >= len(my_sequence):
            i = 0
        if j >= max_iter:
            break


# Alternative solution 1:

    i = 0
    for _ in range(max_iter):

        i += 1
        if i >= len(my_sequence):
            i = 0

    for i in range(max_iter):
        yield my_sequence[i % len(my_sequence)]


for j, element in enumerate(next_element("abcdefg", max_iter=20)):
    print(f"[{j}] element: {element}")


#
# Task 5
#

# Write a generator function that takes an iterable of any type as input and
# yields 2-tuples where the first tuple entry is the number of the current loop
# iteration and the second entry is the current loop element. Do not use the
# existing function "enumerate".

# Your code here #


def my_enumerate(iterable):
    i = 0
    for elem in iterable:
        yield i, elem
        i += 1
