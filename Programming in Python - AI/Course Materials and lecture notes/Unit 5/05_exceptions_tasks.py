"""

#
# Task 1
#

# Write a function that divides two numbers and returns the result. The numbers
# should be taken as keyword arguments with defaults of 1.0 for both values. If
# the division fails due to a "ValueError" or "TypeError", print a warning and
# return None instead.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 2
#

# Write a function "add(a, b)" that returns the sum of "a" and "b". If the
# addition fails due to a "TypeError", convert the values to integers and return
# the sum of the two integers. If this fails due to a "ValueError", convert the
# values to float and return the sum of the two float values. If this fails due
# to a "ValueError", raise the first exception from the first attempt at adding
# the values.

# Your code here #


#
# Task 3
#

# Run the below code. You will see two types of exception errors:
# "ZeroDivisionError" and "IndexError". Change the code such that the function
# "list_division" returns [0.25, "ZDE", "IE", 0.5, "IE"], where "ZDE" is added
# if a "ZeroDivisionError" and "IE" if an "IndexError" was encountered.

# Your code here #
def list_division(num_list1, num_list2):
    results = []

    for num in num_list1:
        results.append(num / num_list2[num])

    return results


list1 = [1, 3, 8, 5, 9]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 0, 3, 10]
print(list_division(list1, list2))


#
# Task 4
#

# Write a function with three input parameters, where the first is a dict, the
# second is a key and the third a default value (with a default argument value
# of None). The user can request a key from the passed dictionary, and in case
# the dictionary does not contain such a key, the default value should be
# returned instead. Solve this task by catching a "KeyError".

# Your code here #


#
# Task 5
#

# Inspect the following code and try to determine the output of the function "f"
# with the given arguments without actually running the code (the goal is to
# understand the program flow).
