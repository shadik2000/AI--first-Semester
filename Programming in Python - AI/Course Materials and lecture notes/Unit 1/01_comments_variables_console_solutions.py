#
# Task 1
#

# Create a variable "a" with the content 1 and a variable "b" with the content
# False.

# Your code here #
a = 1
b = False


#
# Task 2
#

# Convert the following variable "a" into an integer. Take a look at the
# variable in the debugger. What will happen to the floating point number if it
# is converted to an integer?
a = 5.356

# Your code here #
a = int(a)
# Conversion from float to int means we lose the information after the floating
# point!


#
# Task 3
#

# Create a variable "a" with content "test" and a variable "b" that points to
# the same content as "a". Afterward, let "a" point to 2. To which object (if
# any) does "b" point afterward?

# Your code here #
a = "test"
b = a
a = 2
# "b" is bound to the string object "test"


#
# Task 4
#

# Create a variable "a" with content 123 and create a variable "b" pointing to a
# string that consists of the sentence "this is a test " followed by the
# contents of variable "a". Finally, create a variable "c" that repeats this
# sentence 3 times.

# Your code here #
a = 123
b = f"this is a test {a}"
c = b * 3


#
# Task 5
#

# Take a look at the following lines of code. Why does variable "a" have a
# different value than variable "b"? Which of the two version should be used if
# you need the precise value?
a = 123456789123456789
b = int(123456789123456789.0)
print(f"value a: {a}")
print(f"value b: {b}")

# No code required for the solution of this task, only an explanation #
# For variable "a", an integer is used, which is precise. Since Python3 uses
# variable-length integers, we will not run out of bits to encode the value. For
# variable "b", a float is used and then converted to an integer. However, the
# float 123456789123456789.0 cannot be stored in the 64bit Python3 float, so we
# lose precision and effectively end up with a different value. If you want the
# precise value, you should use the integer version.


#
# Task 6
#

# What are the data types of values referenced by variables "a" and "b"? What is
# the role of "_" among the digits? Examine the syntax of the formatting string
# for the content of "a" and "b".
a = 123_456_789.123_456_789
b = 123_456_789
print(f"a: {a}, formatted a: {a:,.4f}")
print(f"b: {b}, formatted b: {b:,d}")

# No code required for the solution of this task, only an explanation #
# The data types of values referenced by variables "a" and "b" are float and
# integer, respectively. "_" underscores are just used to make the numbers
# easier to read, they do not change the values. To print big numbers in an
# easy-to-read way, use following syntax in a formatted string (f""):
# {variable:,.<int number>f} for float numbers (can also be applied to ints)
# {variable:,d} for integer numbers


#
# Task 7
#

# You are given the time period of 1234567.789 total seconds. Print this value
# in the following format:
# "Time period: <int> Days, <int> Hours, <int> Minutes, <float with 2 decimal places> Seconds"
# Hint: You can solve this task by looking at remainders of divisions.
total_seconds = 1_234_567.789

# Your code here #
seconds = total_seconds % 60  # Get the remainder of a division with modulo operation
total_minutes = total_seconds // 60  # Get the floor value of a division
minutes = total_minutes % 60
total_hours = total_minutes // 60
hours = total_hours % 24
total_days = total_hours // 24
print(f"Time period: {int(total_days)} Days, {int(hours)} Hours, {int(minutes)} Minutes, {seconds:,.2f} Seconds")


#
# Task 8
#

# Read a number from the console (you can assume correct user inputs), convert
# it to float and print the result with 2 decimal places.

# Your code here #
number = input("Enter a number: ")
number = float(number)
print(f"{number:.2f}")


#
# Task 9
#

# Read a number from the console (you can assume correct user inputs), convert
# it to int and print the result with a minimum print width of 10. Optional:
# Also add leading zeros and the sign (even if the number is positive).

# Your code here #
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"{number:10d}")
print(f"{number:+010d}")
