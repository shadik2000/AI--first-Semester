The lecture was on the topic of use of “Machine learning for Wireless Communications”. The presentation covers the use of neural network-based equalization and self-interference cancellation and equalization. It also discusses the problem statement and the use of "model-inspired" neural networks. The presentation provides an overview of single-carrier systems and their digital transmission model. The transmitter and receiver components of single-carrier systems are also discussed. The presentation highlights the increasing demands on data rate and reliability in wireless communications.
The problem statement for neural network-based equalization is that the neural network should approximate the optimal estimator at a far lower complexity. It should not be a black-box model, and we want to incorporate model knowledge into "model-inspired" neural networks. The neural network should learn free parameters based on training data.
Lastly, I want to state that the lecture was very new for me and different from any other normal lectures because the use of wireless communication is increasing day by day from smartphones to rockets. But integrating wireless communications with machine learning is less heard about. Hence, it was very fascinating experience to have the opportunity listening this lecture.  All the students were listening to this lecture quite attentively with enthusiasm. So, I think the lecture was very useful and inspirational to the students who were interested in this field. There were many things that I personally found very interesting was how I can use machine learning to improve wireless communications. Overall, the lecture was unsophisticated that could be understood anyone who knows what SAT solving is.
