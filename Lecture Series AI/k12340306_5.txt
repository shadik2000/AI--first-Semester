The lecture was on the topic “Fueling the SAT Revolution in Automated Reasoning” that discussed the advancements in automated reasoning techniques, particularly in satisfiability solving, also known as the SAT revolution. The SAT problem is a key technology for 21st century computer science, and it is at the core of arguably the most fundamental question in computer science: What makes a problem hard? The current generation of automated reasoning techniques excel at the qualitative tasks (i.e., when the answer is Yes or No) owing to the dramatic progress in satisfiability solving. The SAT problem is evidently a killer advancement in the field of automated reasoning because it is key to the solution of so many other problems. The topic also covers the history of SAT solving, including the development of various algorithms and techniques such as Look Ahead, GSAT, WalkSAT, DP, Portfolio, Phase Saving Planning, SAT for Inprocessing, Bounded Variable Elimination, CDCL, ProbSAT, Tseitin Encoding, and SMT.
In summary, SAT is a very useful automated reasoning tool that is used everywhere to solve logical problems and helps in the creation of many important algorithms.
Lastly, I want to state that the lecture was different from any other normal lectures because the SAT solving is something which we have already studied in this semester in more detail manner and hence, the lecture was not at once boring, so everyone was listening to it very calmly and paying attention too. So, I think the lecture was very useful and inspirational to the students who were interested in this field. There were many things that I personally found very interesting was we can make algorithms using SAT which is simple yet powerful thing. Overall, the lecture was unsophisticated that could be understood anyone who knows what SAT solving is.
